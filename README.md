# ContentV: Efficient Training of Video Generation Models with Limited Compute

This project presents ContentV, a novel framework that accelerates DiT-based video generation through three key innovations:
- A minimalist model design that enables effective reuse of pre-trained image generation models for video synthesis
- A comprehensive exploration of a multi-stage, efficient training strategy based on Flow Matching
- A low-cost Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) approach that further enhances generation quality without the need for additional human annotations.

## Quickstart

#### Recommended PyTorch Version

- GPU: torch >= 2.3.1 (CUDA >= 12.2)
- NPU: torch and torch-npu >= 2.1.0 (CANN >= 8.0.RC2). Please refer to [Ascend Extension for PyTorch](https://gitee.com/ascend/pytorch) for the installation of torch-npu.

#### Installation

```sh
git clone https://github.com/bytedance/ContentV.git
pip3 install -r ContentV/requirements.txt
```

#### T2V Generation

```sh
cd ContentV
## For GPU
python3 demo.py
## For NPU
USE_ASCEND_NPU=1 python3 demo.py
```

## Todo List
- [x] Inference code and checkpoints
- [ ] Training code of RLHF
